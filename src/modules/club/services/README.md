## Use Cases

The software in this layer contains _application specific_ business rules. It encapsulates and implements all of the use cases of the system. These use cases orchestrate the flow of data to and from the entities, and direct those entities to use their _enterprise wide_ business rules to achieve the goals of the use case.

We do not expect changes in this layer to affect the entities. We also do not expect this layer to be affected by changes to externalities such as the database, the UI, or any of the common frameworks. This layer is isolated from such concerns.

We _do_, however, expect that changes to the operation of the application _will_ affect the use-cases and therefore the software in this layer. If the details of a use-case change, then some code in this layer will certainly be affected.
